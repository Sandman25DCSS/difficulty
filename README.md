# difficulty
DCSS with difficulty option and some other changes.

1) monster_hp_difficulty=100

Possible values are 1-1000. Monster HP is changed as hp = hp * monster_hp_difficulty / 100;
Default is 100.

1a) monster_xp_difficulty=100

Possible values are 1-1000. Allows to control XP from killing monsters.
XP part which depends on max HP is calculated as maxHP*100/monster_xp_difficulty.
If you want to get the same XP as before, it should have the same value as monster_hp_difficulty. 
For example:
monster_xp_difficulty = 200
monster_hp_difficulty = 200
and you will have monster with 200% HP but the same XP as normal monsters.

Default is -1 i.e. the message is disabled.
